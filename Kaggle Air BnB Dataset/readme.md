# Business Understanding
In this example, business wants to know the following questions:
* Which areas are widely preferred by guests to stay?
* How responsive are hosts for any sort of queries?
* What room types are available to different price range?
* Can we have a prediction based model to for house pricing?

# Data Understanding 
For this step, 
* We will see what all columns are available with us
* How many null values are there in the dataset
* What are the categorical and numeric variables

# Prepare Data 
In this step, we will focus on:
* Data Cleaning
* Dummy columns/variable creation for categorical variables
* Identifying relevant columns for our use-case

# Data Modeling
In this step, we will build 3 predictive models:
* Statistical Model - OLS
* Sklearn Model- Linear Regression
* Ensemble Model - Random Forest

# Evaluate the Results 
Metrics we will use are:
* R2
* MSE - Mean Square Error
